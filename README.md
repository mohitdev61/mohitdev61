# Hi, I'm Mohit! ðŸ‘‹

## About Me

I'm a passionate web developer with expertise in a variety of technologies. My interests lie in creating robust and scalable web applications. I love working with modern frameworks like Laravel, exploring the intricacies of PHP, building interactive user interfaces with React.js, and handling server-side logic with Node.js. API integration is another area where I enjoy working to create seamless and connected applications.

## Technologies I Work With

- **PHP**: A versatile scripting language that powers the server-side of my projects.
- **JavaScript**: I enjoy working on both the client and server side using JavaScript.
- **React.js**: Building dynamic and responsive user interfaces is my forte.
- **Node.js**: Leveraging the power of JavaScript on the server side for scalable applications.
- **API Integration**: Connecting and integrating various APIs to enhance functionality.
